# Katerina Pattern

``` npm run pl:serve ```

``` sass source/css/style.scss source/css/style.css --watch ```



## To do

- This is in the default /source/css/style.scss and seems like it'd be really useful so I should get that running @import "../_patterns/**/*.scss";

- font-family: this needs system in a good stack that's documented
